## SECURITY.md – BioMorphic Instruction Architecture (BIA)

**BIA is a strict behavioral sandbox system. It is not a typical framework. It does not validate logic correctness and does not take responsibility for misuse.**

If the system breaks due to incorrect behavior — the fault is not BIA. The fault is human.

---

### 1. Security Goals
- Validate behavior before allowing access to memory
- Strict separation between validation (Wrapper) and execution (Module)
- Each module gets permission only based on declared labels, and only within the session scope
- Memory is allocated in isolated regions. No leakage, no pointer caching across sessions

---

### 2. Memory Access Policy
- `struct gen` always exists inside `GenSlot`, no raw pointers are exposed
- All memory allocation must go through `MemoryAccess`, under Interface control
- Modules only receive data approved by Wrapper and Interface
- There is no reverse access, no way to obtain raw memory addresses

---

### 3. Behavioral Sandbox Rules
- Each module exposes exactly one public `execute()` function
- Wrapper checks the behavior label before any execution call
- No override, no multiple inheritance, no nested module invocation
- Each module is just a behavioral form expressed under strict RAM constraints

---

### 4. Compile-Time Protection
- Macros like `#define private`, `#define friend`, etc. are banned
- Use `#pragma poison`, `#ifdef __FAST_MATH__`, `#ifdef NDEBUG` to detect unsafe flags
- Flags like `-Ofast`, `-DNDEBUG`, `-ffast-math` are prohibited in secure builds
- If macro overrides or unsafe optimizations are detected → build must fail

---

### 5. Behavior Responsibility
- Every module must define its input type, output type, and have predictable results
- If you bind the wrong module — it's your fault
- If you write garbage logic — the system is not at fault
- If you skip testing — you are responsible

---

### 6. System Limitations
- BIA does not prevent malicious intent from developers
- BIA does not detect behaviors that "look right" but are logically wrong
- BIA does not sandbox lower-level threats (firmware, BIOS, compiler tampering)
- BIA does not block side effects (logging, external I/O) if used irresponsibly

---

### 7. Final Declaration
**BIA is a behavioral sandbox — not a moral one.**

It controls who can call what, when, and how far. It cannot verify your intent.

If you break the system from the inside with valid syntax but bad behavior — it's on you.

**You break it — you bought it.**
