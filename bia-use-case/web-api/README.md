# BIA Use Case â€“ Web API (Sandboxed Access Control)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Design an API system that uses BIA-style behavior sandboxing:
- API requests are wrapped into `Token`s
- `Wrapper` validates the token based on user roles and state
- If valid â†’ pointer to behavior module is granted
- If invalid â†’ no pointer â†’ no logic can run

---

## ðŸ§  BIA Philosophy in API Context
- API doesnâ€™t call logic directly
- API only sends a `Token` representing a request
- Logic (module) exists only if permission is granted
- No valid token â†’ no executable behavior

> **No token â†’ no pointer â†’ no logic â†’ no execution**

---

## ðŸ”— Behavior Processing Flow
1. User calls `POST /user/export`
2. Server generates a token: `{ "label": "export:user", "user_id": 42 }`
3. Wrapper checks:
   - Is this user an admin?
   - Is the account not locked?
4. If passed â†’ return `ExportUserData` module
5. If rejected â†’ return `nullptr` â†’ nothing gets executed

---

## ðŸ“¦ Example Token
```cpp
Token token = { "export:user", 42 };
```

---

## ðŸ”’ Wrapper
```cpp
bool validate(const Token& token, const UserState& user) {
    return token.label == "export:user" && user.role == "admin" && !user.locked;
}
```

---

## ðŸ§© dispatch()
```cpp
Module* dispatch(const Token& token, const UserState& user) {
    if (!validate(token, user)) return nullptr;
    return new ExportUserData();
}
```

---

## âœ… Why BIA for API logic?
- Separates request, validation, and execution clearly
- Eliminates scattered permission checks inside controllers
- Makes each behavior testable in isolation
- Easy to extend without breaking existing routes
