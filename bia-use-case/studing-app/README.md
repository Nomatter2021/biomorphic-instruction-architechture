# BIA Use Case â€“ Educational App (Dataflow)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Simulate a learning system where students can perform actions:
- Request a hint (`RequestHint`)
- Submit an assignment (`SubmitExercise`)
- Undo submission (`UndoSubmission`)

All actions must pass through a sandbox validation layer before being executed.

---

## ðŸ§  Dataflow Principle in BIA
In BIA, data carries no behavior. Behavior is only activated through a validated token.

> No valid token â†’ no granted access â†’ no pointer â†’ no behavior execution

---

## ðŸ”— Action Flow (Dataflow Sandbox)
1. The UI sends a `Token` requesting an action (e.g., `"request:hint"`)
2. The `Wrapper` checks the token's validity:
   - Action label must be correct
   - Student ID must exist in the system
3. If valid â†’ the system grants access to the appropriate `Module`
4. If not valid â†’ **no pointer granted â†’ nothing to call**

---

## ðŸ“¦ Example Token
```cpp
Token token = { "hint", 101 };
```

---

## ðŸ”’ Wrapper â€“ Access Validation
```cpp
bool validate(const Token& token, const std::unordered_set<int>& valid_ids) {
    return token.label == "hint" && valid_ids.count(token.user_id);
}
```

---

## ðŸ§© dispatch() â€“ Grant or Deny Access
```cpp
Module* dispatch(const Token& token, const std::unordered_set<int>& valid_ids) {
    if (!validate(token, valid_ids)) return nullptr;
    return new RequestHint();
}
```

---

## ðŸš« If Access is Denied
- `dispatch()` returns `nullptr`
- No `execute()` function is available to call
- Prevents any logic bypass

> BIA does not use `if (ok) then execute()`  
> â†’ **Instead: if not ok â†’ `execute()` does not even exist in memory**

---

## âœ… Advantages of Dataflow Sandbox
- Behavior is completely isolated from data if access is not granted
- Minimizes logic bugs or misuse
- Suitable for AI sandboxing, autonomous learning, and permission-based logic
